SYNOPSIS
      use Encode;

      # U+3053  \xE3\x81\x93  (no-op)

      # U+FA19  \xEF\xA8\x99  U+795E           not decompose
      # U+4F53  \xE4\xBD\x93  (no-op)

DESCRIPTION
    Encode::UTF8Mac provides a encoding called "utf-8-mac" used in Mac OSX.

    On Mac OSX, utf-8 encoding is used and it is normalized form D
    (characters are decomposed). However, not follow the exact
    specification.

    <http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa2001/qa1173.html>

    Specifically, the following ranges are not decomposed.

      U+2000-U+2FFF
      U+F900-U+FAFF
      U+2F800-U+2FAFF

    In iconv (bundled Mac), this encoding can be using as "utf-8-mac".

    This module adds "utf-8-mac" encoding for Encode, it encode/decode text
    with that rule in mind. This will help when you decode file name on Mac.

ENCODING
    utf-8-mac

        *   Encode::decode('utf-8-mac', $bytes)

            Decode as utf-8, and normalize form C except special range using
            Unicode::Normalize.

        *   Encode::encode('utf-8-mac', $unicode)
